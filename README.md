# face_detection_haarcascades
## A simple Opencv and python project that detects faces and eyes from webcam.

The code is written neat and easy to understand. It uses OpenCV cascadeclassifier to detect face and eyes. The haarcascade features for face and eyes are also added as xml files. So no need of downloading anything separately. Just clone, download and play the code. It's that simple.
